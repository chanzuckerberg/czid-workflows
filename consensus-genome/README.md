# CZ ID Consensus Genome workflow

This workflow performs reference-based consensus genome mapping from metagenomic sequencing assays with spiked primer
enrichment or from amplicon sample sequencing assays.

The workflow has several modes:

- Oxford Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 samples
- Illumina SARS-CoV-2 samples
- Illumina samples of other viruses
- Illumina reads isolated from metagenomic samples via the CZ ID mngs workflow

Based on original work at:
- CZ Biohub SARS-CoV-2 pipeline, https://github.com/czbiohub/sc2-illumina-pipeline
- ARTIC Oxford Nanopore MinION SARS-CoV-2 SOP, https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html

With enhancements and additional modules by the CZI Infectious Disease team.

## Running Consensus-Genome locally

For Consensus Genome workflow we can follow a similar workflow to the `short-read-mngs` presented in wiki: [Running-WDL-workflows-locally](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/czid-workflows/wiki/Running-WDL-workflows-locally).

We first build a local Docker container image with the consensus genome workflow:

```bash
docker build -t czid-consensus-genome czid-workflows/consensus-genome
```

TIPS: For more detailed setup information
 - for miniwdl - https://github.com/openwdl/learn-wdl/blob/master/6_miniwdl_course/0_setup.md
 - for this example - https://github.com/openwdl/learn-wdl/blob/master/6_miniwdl_course/5c_cloud_spec_consensus-genome.md 

## Run 

We then use our local sample configuration file that points to CZ ID's public references for smaller runs:

```bash
miniwdl run --verbose czid-workflows/consensus-genome/run.wdl \
    docker_image_id=czid-consensus-genome \
    fastqs_0=czid-workflows/consensus-genome/test/sample_sars-cov-2_paired_r1.fastq.gz \
    fastqs_1=czid-workflows/consensus-genome/test/sample_sars-cov-2_paired_r2.fastq.gz \
    sample=sample_sars-cov-2_paired \
    technology=Illumina \
    ref_fasta=s3://czid-public-references/consensus-genome/MN908947.3.fa \
    -i czid-workflows/consensus-genome/test/local_test.yml
```

Where:

* `docker_image_id=` should be set to the docker image tag you used when building the image (in our example, `czid-consensus-genome`)
* `czid-workflows/consensus-genome/run.wdl` is the WDL for the consensus genome sequencing workflow.
* `fastqs_0` and `fastqs_1` are the pair of FASTQ files. The ones referred to are small files to run locally.
* `sample` is the name to use where referencing the sample in the output files.
* `technology` is the sequencing technology (options = Illumina or ONT)
* `local_test.yml` supplies boilerplate workflow inputs, such as the S3 paths for the reference databases. For local run purposes, we use lighter references:
  * The human database for host removal only contains chromosome 1.
  * The kraken db used locally only has coronavirus sequences.
