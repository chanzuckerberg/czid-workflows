# Counts reads and bases of a fastq file, raising an error if there are no reads remaining
#   Intended to run after steps that involve filtering the input fasta like host filtering
#   or subsampling

# Arguments:
#   1: path to the fastq file
#   2: a prefix for the output files such as (sample_validated)
#   3: a message to display to the user if all reads are filtered out at this step
