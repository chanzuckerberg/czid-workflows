    """ Remove low-complexity reads to mitigate challenges in aligning repetitive sequences.

    LZW refers to the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm, which provides loss-less data compression.
    The ratio of LZW-compressed sequence length to the original sequence length is computed for each read.
    Reads with a compression ratio greater than the specified threshold of 0.45 are retained.
    In the case where all reads are filtered by this threshold, a reduced threshold of 0.42 is used.
    If reads are greater than 150 basepairs long, the LZW score is scaled to avoid penalizing long reads.
    In particular, for reads longer that 150 basepairs, the raw LZW score is multiplied by the
    adjustment_heuristic = (1 + (seq_length - 150) / 1000).
