## IDSEQ-DAG

idseq_dag is the pipeline execution engine for idseq (see idseq.net). It is a pipelining system that implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the nodes (steps) correspond to individual python classes. The graph is defined using JSON.

The pipeline would be executed locally with local machine resources. idseq-dag could be installed inside a docker container and run inside the container. See the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for our setup.  More details could be found below.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 and up

## Installation

```
cd idseq-dag; pip3 install -e .
```

## Example

```
idseq_dag examples/host_filter_dag.json

```

` idseq_dag --help ` for more options

## Test

```
cd idseq-dag; python3 -m unittest

```

or `python3 -m unittest tests/<module_file> ` for testing individual modules.

## DAG Execution Details

### Composing an example dag json file
There are five basic elements of an IdSeq Dag
 - **name**: the name of the IdSeq Dag.
 - **output_dir_s3**: the s3 directory where the output files will be copied to.
 - **targets**: the outputs that are to be generated through dag execution. Each target consists of a list of files that will be copied to *output_dir_s3*
 - **steps**: the steps that will be executed in order to generate the targets. For each step, the following attributes can be specified:
   * *in*: the input targets
   * *out*: the output target
   * *module*: name of python module
   * *class*: name of python class that inherits from [PipelineStep](idseq_dag/engine/pipeline_step.py)
   * *additional_files*: additional S3 files required for dag execution, i.e. reference files.
   * *additional_attributes*: additional input parameters for the pipeline class
 - **given_targets**: the list of targets that are given. Given targets will be downloaded from S3 before the pipeline execution starts.

The following is an example dag for generating alignment output for idseq. The *host_filter_out* is given, and once downloaded, *gsnap_out* and *rapsearch2_out* steps will run in parallel. When *gsnap_out* and *rapsearch2_out* are both completed, *taxon_count_out* and *annotated_out* will be run simultaneously and the pipeline will be complete once everything is uploaded to S3.

### Design

idseq-dag follows the KISS design principle. There are only two major components for dag execution:

 -  *[PipelineFlow](idseq_dag/engine/pipeline_flow.py)* validates the DAG, downloads the given targets, starts prefetching the additional files in a different thread, starts the pipeline steps in parallel and coordinates the execution.
 -  *[PipelineStep](idseq_dag/engine/pipeline_step.py)* waits for the input targets to be available, executes the run method, validates the output and uploads the files to S3.

Here is a quick example of a PipelineStep implementation for generating [taxon_count_out](master/idseq_dag/steps/combine_taxon_counts.py). Anyone can implement their own step by subclassing PipelineStep and implementing the *run* and *count_reads* method. *count_reads* is a method we use to count the output files. If you are not sure how to implement the count_reads function, just put a dummy function there as shown below.

In the *run* function, you need to make sure your implementation generates all the files specified in the `self.output_files_local()` list. Otherwise, the step will fail, which will trigger the whole pipeline to also fail.

By default, idseq-dag will only execute a step when the output target is not generated yet. You can turn off this caching mechanism with `--no-lazy-run` option with `idseq_dag` command.

```

import json
from idseq_dag.engine.pipeline_step import PipelineStep
import idseq_dag.util.command as command
import idseq_dag.util.count as count

class PipelineStepCombineTaxonCounts(PipelineStep):
    '''
    Combine counts from gsnap and rapsearch
    '''
    def run(self):
        input_files = []
        for target in self.input_files_local:
            input_files.append(target[3])
        output_file = self.output_files_local()[0]
        self.combine_counts(input_files, output_file)


    def count_reads(self):
        pass
    @staticmethod
    def combine_counts(input_json_files, output_json_path):
        taxon_counts = []
        for input_file_name in input_json_files:
            with open(input_file_name, 'r') as input_file:
                data = json.load(input_file)
                taxon_counts += data["pipeline_output"]["taxon_counts_attributes"]
        output_dict = {"pipeline_output": { "taxon_counts_attributes": taxon_counts}}
        with open(output_json_path, 'w') as output_file:
            json.dump(output_dict, output_file)

```

## Developers
When merging a commit to master, you need to increase the version number in `idseq_dag/__init__.py`:
  - if results are expected to change, increase the 2nd number
  - if results are not expected to change, increase the 3rd number.

## Generating reference indices
IDseq DAGs require the use of several indices prepared from files in NCBI. If you need to generate a new version of these indices, please refer to https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-pipeline, specifically the following commands:
  - host_indexing
  - gsnap_indexing
  - rapsearch_indexing
  - blacklist
  - lineages
  - curate_accession2taxid
  - curate_accessionid2seq
  - push_reference_update.
TODO: Move this code over to the idseq-dag repo.

## Release notes
Version numbers for this repo take the form X.Y.Z.
- We increase Z for a change that does not add or change results in any way. Example: adding a log statement.
- We increase Y for a change that adds results, changes results, or has the potential to change results. Example: changing a parameter in the GSNAP command.
- We increase X for a paradigm shift in how the pipeline is conceived. Example: adding a de-novo assembly step and then reassigning hits based on the assembled contigs.
Changes to X or Y force recomputation of all results when a sample is rerun using idseq-web. Changes to Z do not force recomputation when the sample is rerun - the pipeline will lazily reuse existing outputs in AWS S3.

When releasing a new version, please add a Git tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`.

This means that the pipeline now finds the global best taxon match for each read/contig first and only then excludes blacklisted/non-whitelisted taxa from the resulting counts. Previously, it was artifically restricting the search space by applying the blacklist and whitelist to candidate taxa upfront, thus reporting non-optimal matches for affected reads/contigs.

     In comprehensive testing on a diverse set of samples, this has shown just a few minor
     effects on overall results, mostly for reads that align at the limit of detection.
     The benefit of the change is 3x-8x faster performance.  A/B test data is archived
     in slack channel #idseq-benchmarking.

- 1.7.0
    - Add capability to  further filter out host reads by filtering all the hits
      from gsnapping host genomes. (i.e. gsnap hg38/patron5 for humans).

- 1.6.3 ... 1.6.1
    - Handle bogus 0-length alignments output by gsnap without crashing.
    - Fix crash for reruns which reuse compatible results from a previous run.
    - Fix crash for samples with unpaired reads.
    - Improve hit calling performance.

- 1.6.0
    - Fix fasta downloads broken by release 1.5.0, making sure only
      hits at the correct level are output in the deduped m8.
    - Fix fasta download for samples with unpaired reads by eliminating
      merged fasta for those samples.
    - Extend the partial fix in release 1.5.1 to repair more of the
      broken reports.  Full fix requires rerun with updated webapp.
    - Correctly aggregate counts for species with unclassified genera,
      such as e.g. genus-less species 1768803 from family 80864.
    - Fix total count in samples with unpaired reads (no longer doubled).
    - Fix crash when zero reads remain after host filtering.
    - Fix bug in enforcing command timeouts that could lead to hangs.
    - Fix performance regression in stage 2 (non-host alignment)
      introduced with 1.5.0.
    - Deduplicate and simplify much of stage 2, and improve performance
      by parallelizing uploads and downloads.

- 1.5.1
    - Fix bug introduced in 1.5.0 breaking samples with non-species-specific
      deuterostome hits.

- 1.5.0
    - Identify hits that match multiple species within the same genus as
      "non species specific" hits to the genus.

- 1.4.0
    - Version result folder.

- 1.3.0
    - Fix bug causing alignment to run before host subtraction in samples
      with unpaired reads.
    - Include ERCC gene counts from STAR.

- 1.2.0
    - Synchronize pair order after STAR to improve sensitivity in 10% of
      samples with paired-end reads.
