      to 2020-02-01, and the new one, valid from 2020-03-01 to 2020-03-01.
    - The 456 species has been removed between the 2020-01-01 and 2020-02-01 versions, it is
      still in the table, but there are no entries for it under any versions after 2020-01-01
    - The 789 species has been added in the 2020-03-01 version, there is an entry for it in
      that new version but there are no entries for previous versions
    The output of this function is intended to be loaded raw into the CZID web application's
