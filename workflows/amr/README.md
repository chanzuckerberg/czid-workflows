# CZ ID AMR Workflow

CZ ID's AMR workflow implements the [Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI)](https://github.com/arpcard/rgi) tool for AMR sequence detection. The RGI tool is used to compare quality controlled reads and assembled contigs against AMR references sequences from the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) (CARD).  Further documentation on how to use the CZ ID AMR workflow, including a [workflow visualization](https://chanzuckerberg.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15091031482644-AMR-Pipeline-Workflow) can be found in the [CZ ID help center](https://chanzuckerberg.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/15001531592980-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Analysis).

# Changelog

## 1.3.3 - Tentative

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue where the `RunRedup` task would hang when processing samples with large amounts of duplicate sequence data. `grep` has been replaced with `awk` when processing the duplicate cluster sizes tsv and clusters csv files.
- Fixes an issue where `RunRedup` output fasta files were inconsistently named.

### Changed

- Harmonizes file naming in `RunRedup` to use underscores (_) instead of dashes (-).
- Now uses [a fork](https://github.com/lvreynoso/rgi/commit/a14f8dd5457a6220a06024b6aebd05e8cb6181d7) of rgi version 6.0.3, with changes to fix an issue with parsing BAM files. Previously the AMR workflow used a fork of rgi version 6.0.0.

## 1.3.2 - 2023-11-21

### Fixed

- Samples that have valid k-mer coverage histograms but do not generate any contigs from SPAdes assembly will no longer cause an error in `RunRgiMain`, which does not allow for empty contigs files.

## 1.3.1 - 2023-11-15

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where in the case of a sample that had duplicate reads, the `RunRedup` task failed to include reads from the subsampled reads file.
- Fixed a bug where the non-host reads output file was in FASTQ format instead of the expected FASTA format.

## 1.3.0 - 2023-09-29

### Added

- Duplicate reads that correspond with a read present in the subsampled reads used as input are now interleaved with subsampled reads before being used as input to the rest of the workflow. This should result in more accurate reporting of reads-based statistics in the workflow output (number of reads, reads per million, coverage depth, and depth per million reads).

### Fixed

- Input parameters that expect a non-empty array are now declared as `Array[T]+` instead of `Array[T]`.
- Variables that were in camelCase have been renamed to conform to snake_case to be consistent with the rest of the workflow.

### Changed

- The workflow's input parameters for declaring sample input files has changed. Samples must now be declared using one of either the `RawSample` struct or the `FilteredSample` struct. The `FilteredSample` struct, meant for samples that have previously undergone host filtering in CZID, requires a file containing all non-host reads as well as two tsv files describing duplicate reads clusters and their sizes, in addition to the previously needed subsampled reads and contigs files.

## 1.2.15 - 2023-07-19

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused the calculated gene coverage percentage to be incorrect in some cases, i.e. when only a reverse read was present in the contigs of a paired-end sample.

## 1.2.14 - 2023-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused contig IDs to be improperly parsed when creating the indexed contigs BAM/BAI files. This caused the workflow to halt in some cases.

### Changed

- The workflow now expects the `card_ontology` file to be organized by drug class, which should be the top-level keys in the JSON structure of the file. The code that generates the primary AMR report now queries the file by drug class instead of gene name to obtain high-level drug classes.


## 1.2.13 - 2023-07-17

1.2.13 is identical to 1.2.12.

## 1.2.12 - 2023-07-17

### Added

- Added ARO accession number as a column in the primary AMR report.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that prevented contigs without corresponding read IDs to be indexed in the contigs BAM/BAI files. All contigs in a sample for a given gene can now be accessed by using the gene's ARO accession number as a key.

### Changed

- Contigs in the indexed BAM/BAI files are now indexed by ARO accession, not read IDs.

## 1.2.11 - 2023-07-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused the workflow to halt if an ontology entry did not have a `highLevelDrugClasses` key.
- Fixed a bug that caused identified genes to not show up in the primary AMR report if they did not have a high-level drug class in the ontology.

## 1.2.10 - 2023-07-10

NOTE: Due to a bug in our release script, there were no releases with version numbers 1.2.6 - 1.2.9.

### Added

- Added seqkit 2.4.0 to the AMR Dockerfile.
- Added workflow parameter `File card_ontology`. The workflow expects this to be a customized JSON file containing the contents of the CARD ontology, with AMR gene names as top-level keys.
- Added high-level drug classes to primary AMR report. The workflow queries the `card_ontology` file.
- Added sample ontology file for testing purposes.

### Changed

- The interleaved non-host reads file now renames duplicate sequence IDs with seqkit. The renamed IDs have a forward slash and a counter  appended to them: `/1`, `/2`, etc.

## 1.2.5 - 2023-06-13

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in calculating gene coverage. Contigs are now grouped by ARO accession instead of model ID before calculating coverage.
- Pinned `dask` version to `2023.5.0` to prevent installation of newer versions incompatible with Python 3.8.

### Changed
- Updated `requests` to version 2.31.0.

## 1.2.4 - 2023-05-23

### Added

- Added this README file.

### Changed

- Updated CARD database files.

## 1.2.3 - 2023-05-18

### Added

- Nudged results from running RGI on contigs are now included in the primary AMR report. These rows have the value "Nudged" in the "Cut_Off_contig_amr" column.

### Changed

- RGI is now called with the `--include_nudge` flag on contigs in task `RunRgiMain`.

## 1.2.2 - 2023-05-16

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused creation of the indexed contig BAM file to error out if SPAdes assembly failed. The task now outputs an empty BAM file.

## 1.2.1 - 2023-05-10

Version 1.2.1 is unchanged from 1.2.0.

## 1.2.0 - 2023-05-10

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused all gene names in the AMR reports to be entirely lowercase.

## 1.1.2 - 2023-05-10

### Added

- Added Python test for the WDL task which generates reports as TSV files, `RunResultsPerSample`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that occurred when determining ARO accessions for rows in the primary AMR report.
- Removed carriage return characters from workflow test data.

## 1.1.1 - 2023-04-25

### Fixed

- Fixed the filename specified for the non-host reads file produced by `ZipOutputs`.

## 1.1.0 - 2023-04-25

### Changed

- The non-host reads file output by `ZipOutputs` is no longer compressed with gzip.

## 1.0.0 - 2023-04-25

### Added

- Contigs indexed by gene are now output as a BAM/BAI file pair from new task `tsvToSam`.
- A new column to the primary AMR report `read_gene_id` that can be used to look up sequences in the above-mentioned contigs bam file.

### Fixed

- The workflow will now only interleave non-host reads as part of the `ZipOutputs` task if two files are present. Interleaving is skipped for workflows where all non-host reads are contained in a single file.

### Changed

- The non-host reads used for workflow runs on unfiltered samples now use the subsampled output from host filtering. Previously, the workflow used reads that were output from the host filtering process before subsampling.

## 0.2.3 - 2023-04-13

### Added

- Dockerfile: Add SeqFu for interleaving input files.
- Non-host reads interleaved in a single file is now an output of `ZipOutputs`.
- Contigs are also now an output of `ZipOutputs`.

### Changed

- Renamed `ZipOutputs` input parameter `output_files` to `contigs_in`.

### Removed

- Removed input parameter `Int? total_reads`
- Removed task `GetTotalReads`.

## 0.2.2 - 2023-02-07

### Added

- New workflow input parameter `File wildcard_index`.

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in `MakeGeneCoverage` task.
- Fixed a bug in `MakeGeneCoverage` that did not account for zero-length output when writing results to `gene_coverage.tsv`.
