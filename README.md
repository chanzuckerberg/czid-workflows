# czid-workflows - portable CZ ID production pipeline logic

#### Infectious Disease Sequencing Platform
CZ ID is a hypothesis-free global software platform that helps scientists identify pathogens in metagenomic sequencing
data.

- **Discover** - Identify the pathogen landscape
- **Detect** - Monitor and review potential outbreaks
- **Decipher** - Find potential infecting organisms in large datasets

CZ ID is a collaborative open project of [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/) and
[Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://czbiohub.org).

## Workflows
Currently we have 5 main workflows. The details of each pipeline are in a README in each of the workflow folders. 

* [short-read-mngs](workflows/short-read-mngs/README.md) 
* [consensus-genome](workflows/consensus-genome/README.md)
* [phylotree-ng](workflows/phylotree-ng/README.md)
* long-read-mngs (Beta)
* amr (Beta)

## Running these workflows
This repository contains [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) workflows that the [CZ ID](https://czid.org) platform uses in
production. See [Running WDL workflows locally](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/czid-workflows/wiki/Running-WDL-workflows-locally)
to get started with them.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Lint and unit tests run on GitHub from jobs in `.github/workflows/wdl-ci.yml`
(triggered on every commit).
