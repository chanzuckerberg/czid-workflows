# s3quilt

s3quilt is two functions to download ranges from an S3 object in parallel. It is written in Go to take advantage of Go's easy and fast concurrency. The intended use case is using a byte index into an S3 object to only download the parts you need from a very large S3 object instead of downloading the whole object. This is performance critical for us because we download a lot of small pieces from NR and NT. Previously, we pre-downloaded all of NR and NT upfront but we ran into issues with them being too large for any one machine. However, having the whole index locally makes lookups very fast, so fast we did it sequentially. To make up for the performance cost of doing a lot of fetches we need to use concurrent code. This is possible in python but it will be both easier to implement and more performant in Go.
